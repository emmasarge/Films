# FilmBase: 
Search and Save your favourite films


### Objective: To make an interactive App with React using OMDB API to search for films. The app must be responsive for mobile. 


### Issues
---
* This is the first app I have attempted using React and I am having difficulty deploying the app via heroku or github, I need assistance for this. 
* I would like to add animation to the modal but I need to learn more about react-spring.
* Connecting with API was hard at first, found a youtube using OMDB to show me how. 


### Testing 
---
* React Jest installed in CLI identified errors and prohibited project from displaying when errors are found
* Chrome developer Tools
*

### Future Goals
* I will admit I was overly ambitious to embark making an app with react for the first time, part of me is kicking myself for not using javascript and jquery instead but this was a good push. I would like another week learning React more in depth and I think I can fix this app up to be more slick.
* I would like the Favourite films header to not be present when there are no saved favourites, I would like to make an event for the header to only show when favourites are saved.
* I would like to adjust the colors.
* I would like to adjust the layout.
